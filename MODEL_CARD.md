# Vekol-TTS (Sorani, edge)

Central Kurdish (Sorani) text-to-speech that runs offline on CPU. A small ONNX model
(~77 MB) that turns Sorani text into a 22.05 kHz WAV, faster than real time on a laptop
CPU. Part of the Vekol hub by Revge.

- Model: `vekol-tts-ckb-edge`
- Language: Central Kurdish / Sorani (`ckb`), Arabic script
- Voice: one male Sorani voice
- Architecture: VITS (Piper recipe), fine-tuned two-stage, exported to ONNX
- Size: `model.onnx` ≈ 77 MB, 22.05 kHz
- Runtime: ONNX Runtime (CPU)

## License

CC-BY-NC 4.0 (non-commercial). Built with the Piper VITS recipe and trained with audio
from the Vekol server model (built on Coqui XTTS, non-commercial), so it inherits
non-commercial terms. See `NOTICE`. Commercial use needs a model retrained from a
permissively-licensed base on permissively-licensed audio.

## Usage

The simplest path is the `vekol_tts.py` helper from the GitHub repo, which downloads this
model and handles text normalization (variant folding, number reading, no dropped letters):

```bash
pip install onnxruntime numpy scipy huggingface_hub
python3 vekol_tts.py "ئەمڕۆ کەشەکە خۆشە" out.wav
```

It's a standard Piper/VITS ONNX graph, so it also runs directly via ONNX Runtime using the
`model.onnx.json` phoneme map (inputs: `input`, `input_lengths`, `scales`, `sid`), or through
the Piper / sherpa-onnx runtimes.

## Notes

- The character map uses Sorani keheh `ک` (U+06A9) natively — no remapping needed. The
  helper folds typed variants (`ك`→`ک`, `ھ`→`ه`, `ة`→`ە`, `ى`→`ی`, hamza, ZWNJ/tatweel) so
  nothing is dropped, and reads numbers as Kurdish words.
- Output is 22.05 kHz: clear and accurate, intended for on-device/CPU use.
- Runs through ONNX Runtime on many platforms (C++, Rust, Go, Android, iOS, Raspberry Pi,
  e.g. via sherpa-onnx or Piper).
